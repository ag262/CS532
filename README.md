This machine learning project involves classifying handwritten, chinese characters that represent 15 different numerical values (thus there are 15 classes for the data). The images are from: https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/chinese-mnist

The three algorithms used are 1) kNN, 2) SVM, and 3) CNN.

If you wish to run the analysis of the data yourself, follow these steps:

1) Download the non-preprocessed data from the link above.
2) Run "preprocess_data.py" to generate the preprocessed data.
3) Run one of the three other .py files (e.g. "kNN.py") to see the misclassification error of the model on either the non-preprocessed or preprocessed data.
